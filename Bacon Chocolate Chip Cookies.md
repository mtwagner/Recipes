Bacon Chocolate Chip Cookies

# Wet Ingredients  
1/2 cup butter  
1/4 cup granulated sugar  
1/2 cup dark brown sugar  
1 egg  
1/2 tsp vanilla

# Dry Ingredients  
1 1/8 cups flour
1/2 tsp soda
Pinch of salt
3/4 cup chocolate chips
4 strips thick cut bacon (diced)

# Steps  
Grease or line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone pad.  
Dice and render bacon. Put bacon onto paper towels to removed rendered fat.  
With electric mixer, cream together the butter and the two sugars until light and fluffy.  
In another bowl, mix egg and vanilla, then gradually beat into the butter mixture. Sift over the flour, soda and salt. Stir to blend.  
Add the chocolate chips and bacon, and mix to combine thoroughly.  
Refrigerate for 30 minutes.  

Preheat oven to 350F degrees.  
Place heaped teaspoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. 
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes until lightly colored. With a metal spatula, transfer to a wire rack to cool.  

Makes ~24 cookies.  

For chewy cookies, bake in less time. If cookies are too hard after baking, store in airtight container with a piece of plain white bread.
